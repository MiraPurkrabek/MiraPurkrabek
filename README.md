## 🧑‍🔬 About Me

I am a computer vision researcher passionate about state-of-the-art deep learning for visual human body analysis.
My work focuses on human pose estimation, detection, and segmentation and multi-task learning — pushing the boundaries of in-the-wild human body analysis.
I’m especially interested in robust, efficient methods for real-world vision problems and developing open-source solutions for the research community.

- 🔬 Currently working on advanced methods for human pose estimation and multi-body detection.
- 🏆 ICCV 2025 & CVPR 2025 first-author.
- 🌱 I enjoy player tracking in team sports and building methods for dense, complex scenes. I want to make computer vision methods robust enough to use in real-world (eg. sports).
